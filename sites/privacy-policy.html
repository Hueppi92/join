      <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
      <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
      <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on Section 25 Para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for contract fulfillment or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information about the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transmission of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary as part of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal basis permits the data disclosure. When using processors, we only pass on personal data from our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

      <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
      <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
      <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
      <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>
      <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
      <p>Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions about personal data.</p>
      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
      <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
      <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
      <li>If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from its storage – only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
